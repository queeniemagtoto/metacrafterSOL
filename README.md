# metacrafterSOL
### Executing program
To run this program, you need to Remix and you can access this by searching https://remix.ethereum.org/.
you can see the Pragma Solidity which means it enables the compiler features. 
By creating a new file, you need to click File Explorer on the sidebar. Add a file with a .sol extension. 
The contract will include public variables that will contain information about your token (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply).
Addresses will be mapped to balances in your contract (address => uint).
A mint function will have two parameters: an address and a value. 
The function then multiplies that number by the whole supply and multiplies it by the balance of the "sender" address.
### Compile Code
by compiling it, you need to click on the sidebar the Solidity Compiler. Click the auto compile and click the compile Token.sol.
### Deploy & Run
Click the Deploy & Run transactions below the Solidity Compiler that you'll see on the sidebar. Copy the address that you can see on the account. 
At Deploy & Run transactions you'll see the environment, account, gas limit, value, and contract. 

In the contract tab, you see the token.sol and deploy it. After deploying it, you can see in the output the green check means it works. 
Below is 'deployed contracts' Click that, paste the address you've copied before, and paste it to the 'burn' and 'mint' section. You can add value and click transact.
